				<p>Liverpool are endearingly excited about getting back to this stage - their eighth final but first in 11 years - and know that they are inferior to Madrid. They also know that such excitement - or, rather, the electrical charge that Klopp infuses his team with - is the core of their best quality and the ability to regularly best such sides. They have all the belief that comes from that.The Liverpool squad, however, are said to be “tuned in” to that. Klopp has his team ready to undercut any Real overconfidence, to fatally challenge any complacency.The German spoke of how Liverpool will “adjust” to what Madrid do, and therein might lie the winning of this game.</p>

				<p>As it’s normally the case when it comes to a major final, the subplots are just as intriguing as the main event and they don’t come much more exciting than the prospect of seeing Cristiano Ronaldo and Mohamed Salah battle it out for European soccer’s biggest trophy.The pair have been integral to their respective sides’ march towards Kiev and have both scored 44 goals in all competitions this season, although the latter has played eight more games than the former.Ronaldo has shrugged off an indifferent start to the season to plunder 15 goals in the Champions League, making him the competition’s top scorer going into the final.Salah, meanwhile, has been an absolute revelation in his first season back in the Premier League since moving to Liverpool from AS Roma in the summer for $49.2 million last summer. The Egyptian has scored 11 goals in the Champions League–including one in the qualifying stage–and set the record for the most goals in a Premier League over 38 games, breaking a record previously jointly held by Ronaldo, Luis Suarez and Alan Shearer</p>
